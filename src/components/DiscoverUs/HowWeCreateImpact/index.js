				People Beyond Borders is a bridge, co-creating safe spaces and

				find contextual and durable solutions to tackle the root causes of some
				of the world’s biggest challenges. We believe in the power of coming

expressive arts to facilitate a strong
foundation for safe spaces and enhance
psychosocial support. This encompasses all
art forms including visual art, theatre, music,
movement, photography, creative writing and
nature-based art therapy. We also bring in
fun cooking sessions, and cultural
activities. There is growing evidence
combined from over 900 publications and
organizations, including the World Health
Organization (WHO) that art is a powerful
prescription. WHO reported how “Art
Wellness” has moved from sidelines to
center-stage, while bringing culture and
social sectors together to treat specific health
conditions. We believe that creativity can
spark honest conversations and reflections
not just between people but also within
ourselves. With this shared sense of
playfulness and trust, we are able to unfold
through multilayered stories, meaningful
connections and personal growth through
arts.`,

		title: 'Participatory Action Research',
		content: `Sometimes what people think or say is very
different from what they do. How do
we approach their doing? All of our work is
rooted in Participatory Action Research
(PAR), so that our action plans are based on
the real-life actions of the displaced people
we work with. For us, research is dynamic
rather than static where all involved
stakeholders engage as co-researchers
constantly transforming their own spaces by
bringing knowledge alive! PAR sets out to be
participatory based on the perspective that
“knowledge are plural”

, which further

challenges some of the assumptions about
displacement/refugee homogeneity in
conventional studies. While many tend to
consider displaced people as a homogenous
entity, our research articulates that the
displaced are internally diverse and there are
power dynamics between them that shape
their intra-social cohesion. We develop our
initiatives to channelize this diversity and
plural voices in innovative ways.`,
