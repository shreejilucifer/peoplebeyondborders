				Either most are internally displaced persons (IDPs) in their home
				countries or about 80% of those displaced tend to seek refuge in their
				neighboring countries. Overburdened developing countries face the
				repercussions when political authorities shut doors for displaced
				persons. In such situations, it is underestimated how local people
				support the displaced. Often, it is the vulnerable, disadvantaged
				communities as well as those who themselves might be IDPs in their
				country that end up hosting the refugees and displaced people. Hosting
				isnâ€™t limited to providing resources but also includes being a liaison,
				creating support structures, sharing livelihood opportunities and
				enhancing the overall wellbeing. It is powerful to see how humans
				empower humans!

				Why does any of this matter? It matters because empathy, resilience,
				care, hope and strength drive us even when at times it might feel that
				we are operating from the lack of it. It matters because we have the
				agency to transform our own stories, narratives, spaces and empower
				those around us.
